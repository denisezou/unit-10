Hi, this is my late submission of the LIRI bot in efforts to pass the certificate program The Coding Bootcamp at Northwestern University (January 2019- July 2019). This node-based program does the following activities on command:

1. If you type "node liri.js do-what-it-says" in the terminal, it will read the random.txt file, which should search "I want it that way" using the Spotify API and give you some facts about the song. 

2. If you type "node liri.js concert-this" followed by an artist you'd like to search, it will search the Bands In Town API and give you some facts about all the upcoming concerts by that artist. If you don't specify an artist, it will default to showing the upcoming concerts by The Rolling Stones. 

3. If you type "node liri.js spotify-this-song" followed by a song you'd like to search, it will search the Spotify API and give you some facts about the song such as release date, popularity score out of 100, and artist name. If you don't specify a song, it will default to The Sign by the Ace of Base. 

4. If you type "node liri.js movie-this" followed by a movie you'd like to search, it will search the OMDB API and give you some facts and a brief description of the film you searched. If you don't specify a movie, it will default to Mr. Nobody (2009).
